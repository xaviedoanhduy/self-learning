## 📘 About This Project

This project is a personal journey of **self-learning** — a continuous process of exploring, understanding, and mastering new knowledge and skills without formal instruction.

It documents lessons, experiments, reflections, and resources gathered along the way.  
The goal is to **grow through curiosity, discipline, and creation.**

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Learn by Doing**  
   Don’t wait for the perfect course. Start small, make mistakes, and learn actively.

2. **Be Consistent**  
   Learning every day, even for 15 minutes, is more powerful than cramming for hours.

3. **Teach to Learn**  
   The best way to master something is to explain it clearly — to others or even to your future self.

4. **Build Projects, Not Just Notes**  
   Theory is valuable, but creating something tangible transforms information into understanding.

5. **Reflect Regularly**  
   Write down what you learned, what worked, and what didn’t.
